# End-to-End Data Science Project

This repository presents an end-to-end data science project that demonstrates
the complete data science workflow across multiple learning paradigms,
from structured data modeling to natural language processing.

The project is divided into three main parts, each focusing on a different
machine learning setting and highlighting both modeling and analytical decisions.

## Project Overview

### Part 1 – Supervised Learning
House price prediction using regression models, with emphasis on
data exploration, feature engineering, hyperparameter optimization,
and model explainability using SHAP and LIME.

### Part 2 – Unsupervised Learning
Clustering analysis using the DBSCAN algorithm on multiple datasets,
focusing on parameter selection, clustering evaluation metrics,
and visualization through dimensionality reduction.

### Part 3 – Natural Language Processing
Sentiment analysis of movie reviews using different text representation techniques.
The analysis compares TF-IDF, Word2Vec, and combined embedding approaches
to understand their impact on model performance.

## Technologies
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn
- XGBoost
- SHAP, LIME
- NLP embeddings (TF-IDF, Word2Vec)

Each part includes code, explanations, and summarized insights derived
from the analysis.
