# End-to-End Data Science Project

This repository presents an end-to-end data science project covering
multiple learning paradigms, from structured data modeling to text analysis.

The project is divided into three main parts, each focusing on a different
machine learning setting.

## Project Overview

### Part 1 – Supervised Learning
House price prediction using regression models.
The workflow includes data exploration, feature engineering, model training,
hyperparameter optimization, and explainability using SHAP and LIME.

### Part 2 – Unsupervised Learning
Clustering analysis using the DBSCAN algorithm on multiple datasets.
Includes parameter selection, evaluation using clustering metrics,
and visualization via dimensionality reduction.

### Part 3 – Natural Language Processing
Sentiment analysis of movie reviews using text embeddings.
Compares TF-IDF, Word2Vec, and combined embedding approaches.

## Technologies
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn
- XGBoost
- SHAP, LIME
- NLP embeddings (TF-IDF, Word2Vec)

Each part includes code, explanations, and summarized insights.
