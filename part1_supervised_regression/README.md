# Part 1 – Supervised Learning (House Price Prediction)

## Goal
Train regression models to predict house prices and evaluate performance using MAE.

## Workflow
- Data exploration and EDA
- Handling missing values and outliers
- Feature engineering (added new features)
- Training + hyperparameter optimization
- Explainability using SHAP and LIME

## Notebook
See: `notebooks/part1_supervised_regression.ipynb`
